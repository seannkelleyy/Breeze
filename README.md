# Breeze
Author: Sean Kelley

Breeze is a Budgeting App that allows users to create new budgets by adding expenses and categories. I built it to showcase my full stack development skills as well as practice. 

Tech Stack:
React with TypeScript, Axios, ReactQuery, C# and Entity Framework, SQL Databse, Auth0 for security. I have also hosted this application in Azure and got experience with creating, deploying and troubleshooting the process of hosting applications in the cloud. 

Getting Started:
  1. Clone the repo to Visual Studio to set up the backend.
  2. Run the backend
  3. Clone the Repo to Visual Studio Code, or any other editor that you prefer.
  4. In the terminal at the root of /Breeze.Web, run the command "npm install"
  5. After the install, you can run the command "npm run dev"
  6. After all of this, the backend should be running and your frontend should be as well, next you need to setup a connection string for your database.
  7. After setting up a database, get the connection string and add it to the file named "appsettings.development.json" in the /Breeze.API folder in the backend.
  8. Your application should be good to go at this point.
